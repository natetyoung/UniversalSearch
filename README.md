# UniversalSearch
Experiments in searching very large spaces <br>
This project so far tackles the problem of searching for inputs to Turing machines that produce a given output. 
It isn't solvable in the general case because of the Halting problem, but this project restricts the running time of the algorithms so it is.<br>
Currently, this project is about transforming that problem into a tree search problem that can be solved with dfs, bfs, ucs, etc.
